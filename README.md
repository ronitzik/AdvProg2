# Collections and Files

This repository contains a Gradle project with several Java classes divided into two packages.
The project is part of an exercise completed during the "Advanced Programming" course. The exercises involve implementing various methods in these classes, focusing on handling streams, filtering,
reading binary data, and sorting using random access files.
